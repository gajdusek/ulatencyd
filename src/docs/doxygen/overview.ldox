--! @bug This documentation was written mostly by a man having pure English knowledge and needs massive correction.
--! ## How is ulatencyd lua API documented
--! Before lua files get passed to the Doxygen documentation generator they are prefiltered with
--! [doxygen-lua perl script](https://github.com/alecchen/doxygen-lua). This is because Doxygen does not have native lua
--! support. This attitude has several hiccups:
--! - References to class methods appeare as `table::method()` rather then `table:method()`.
--! - Documentation of files are a bit useless as they may be incorrectly parsed by doxygen-lua.
--! - No sense of `local` keyword.
--! - Call/caller graphs of lua functions cannot be generated.
--! - We define some lua pseudo types (tables) solely for documentation purposes; to describe anonymous tables returned by functions,
--!   structures exported from C core and third-party libraries, pseudo classes and interfaces used to describe objects inheritance (like flags and filters).
--!
--! ### Classes members visibility
--! Lua has no concept of classes (tables) members visibility (public, proctected, private), though the visibility used in documentation
--! provides only additional grouping level:
--! - **public**: for members which are suitable to use outside the class scope
--! - **protected**: generally not useful outside the scope of class
--! - **private**: internals, useful only within the scope of class, commonly being prefixed with underscore '_'
--!   or defined as local.
--!
--! ## Ulatencyd overview
--! ulatencyd can be viewed as having 3 functional modules:
--!
--! - @link lua_CORE core@endlink, which does process parsing, building a process tree, etc.
--! - @link lua_RULES rules@endlink, which categorize the processes, analyze the system etc.
--! - the @link lua_SCHEDULER scheduler@endlink, which uses the information collected by the core and rules to make
--!   decisions on the processes.
--!
--! ### core
--! The core listens on the kernel when new processes are spawned or exit and runs the @link lua_FILTERS filters@endlink
--! and @link lua_SCHEDULER scheduler@endlink on them.
--! Additionally, a scheduler full @ref ulatency.run_iteration "iteration" is run every configurable number of seconds (default 12) on all processes. This is
--! required for example when @link lua_FLAGS flags@endlink, set on a process, expire and the scheduler will make another decision.
--!
--! Both, the scheduler and most of filters, are implemented in the lua rules files. They can use the C core
--! functionality exported via lua bindings. For example most variables and functions implemented in the C code are
--! exported in `#ulatency` global lua table.
--!
--! The core functionality is further extended by the `src/lua/*.lua` files which extend `#ulatency` and `#U_PROC`
--! classes, define `#CGroup` class and other miscellaneous functions that rules (filters, timeout functions and
--! scheduler) may use.
--!
--! The core of course has much more duties, e.g.:
--! - registering available modules (DBUS, xwatch)
--! - registering @ref lua_TIMEOUTS "timeout functions" from the lua rules to be dispatched by main loop
--! - and more
--!
--! ### rules
--! Generally, the rules are **all lua files** in the `ulatency.path_rules_directory`.
--! The rules files implement @link lua_FILTERS filters@endlink, @link lua_TIMEOUTS timeout functions@endlink
--! and the @link lua_SCHEDULER scheduler@endlink; and register them to the core.
--!
--! The rules are loaded
--! according the configuration in `/etc/ulatencyd/ulatencyd.conf`, where you can exclude some rules
--! from being loaded. Further, when you are starting ulatencyd from command line, you can specify entirely different rules directory and
--! the pattern files must match to be loaded.
--!
--! @anchor rule_disambiguation
--! @attention
--! **Rules disambiguation**<br>
--! The "rules" term is often used in ambiguous meanings, it can stand for
--! - all lua files in the `ulatency.path_rules_directory` (as used in above documentation)
--! - @link lua_FILTERS filters@endlink defined in lua rules files together with filters created by
--!   @link lua_SIMPLERULES simplerules module@endlink.
--! - mappings saying to which cgroup a process will be put, i.e. the essence of the default scheduler configurations
--!
--! ### scheduler
--! The scheduler is a lua table (defined in one of the rule files), implementing the u_scheduler interface,
--! that is assigned to global `scheduler` variable (exported to lua via `ulatency.scheduler`). So strictly speaking, scheduler should be
--! considered as part of the @link lua_RULES rules@endlink.
--!
--! Some settings are adjustable in /etc/ulatencyd/ulatencyd.conf and the cgroups that will be used can be changed in
--! /etc/ulatencyd/cgroups.conf
--!
--! The rules and the scheduler can be adjusted by the user to his wishes.
