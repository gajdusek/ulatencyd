 * Prints critical warning if process exists in /proc/ directory and is not

 * If DEVELOP_MODE defined, this assertion is called everytime some process
 * is marked as dead, specifically on each U_PROC_STATE(P, UPROC_VANISHED) or
 * U_PROC_STATE(P, UPROC_ZOMBIE) macro call. Assertion failure in this case is
 * a symptom that ulatencyd core is making false assumptions about /proc/<pid>/
 * files behaviour, i.e. it falsely assumes some process disappeared or is
 * a zombie, instead it is still alive.
